            <h1>END HOUSING ALIENATION NOW!</h1>
            <h2>a cross-Canada super-studio to redesign our housing system from the ground up</h2>
            <h3>September 2025 – May 2026  </h3>

            <div class="interior">
                <h4>End Housing Alienation Now! </h4>
                <p>Housing is one of the most critical issues in Canada in c\a\n\a\d\a is characterized by unaffordability, disrepair, under-housing, precarity, and homelessness. Unaffordability seems to reach new heights each year, home ownership rates have declined, and precarity and homelessness are a constant presence almost everywhere. At the root of these problemsThis is housing alienation—the condition of being separated from our fundamental connections to home. Alienation separates us from the land we inhabit, the social world that supports us, and our full creative lives.  In short, Tthe housing system in Canada is broken and needs to be redesigned from the ground up.  </p>
                <p>Historically, Tthe transformation of land and homes into profit-generating commodities has caused alienation. This condition began with colonial land dispossession. When European settlers arrived in Canada, they began a process that not only violently took land away from Indigenous peoples and worked to erase, but also attacked Indigenous ways of knowing and doing. Through this encounter, land became conceptualized as private property, reserved for the exclusive use of its owner and at the same time easily exchanged, throwing something as rooted as land into circulation.  </p>
                <p>Today, homes are designed to be exchangeable assets. They follow the rules of real estate speculation so that they can store wealth and be easily traded for profit, resulting in environments that are racist, sexist, and classistperpetuate problems like racial and class segregation. Housing alienation disproportionately robs the working class, women, and racializedaffects marginalized people, limiting their self-determination of their power to determine for themselves the means of their survival and flourishing. Further, marketProfit-driven housing production applies pressures that value profit over fair  depends on exploitative labour practices and the degradation of the environmental through unsustainabilityle construction and resource extraction.    </p>
                <p>We can end housing alienation by rebuilding connections to land, to community, and to creative self-determination. We believe that there is no better place to base this effort than in the design studios of Canada’s architecture schools. The next generation of architects in Canada not only brings the perspective of those who will face the uncertainties of the future housing market, but is best positioned to carry this monumental task forward. Learning about the conditions that have led to this point and using the tools that designers hold—while working in collaboration with partners who bring their own expertise in policy, local knowledge, construction, and beyond—gives us the best hope. As students, teachers, activists, advocates, and architects, we are learning collaboratively to design housing that is socially, ecologically, and creatively empowering for all, while contributing to the political will and economic and policy frameworks that support them. </p>
 

                <h4>Cross Canada Superstudio </h4>

 

<p>For the very first time, all architecture schools inacross Canada are coming together to simultaneously teach design studios around a shared goal: To end housing alienation. This unprecedented Super-s Studio meets a momentous pedagogical challenge: To prepare tomorrow’s designers to create housing that meaningfully contributes to improving housing for all.  </p>
<p>At the heart of the Super Sstudio format is the belief that that there is a profound strength in numbers and that all big challenges require collaboration. It therefore's  incredibly exciting that eleven higher learning institutions are participating in this Super Sstudio to share knowledge, inspiration, and foster solidarity. We areThrough the studio we will be simultaneously educating ourselves in a vast array of knowledge and technique, inventing new design methods and solutions, and building a large movement for change. </p>
<p><strong>The Super Sstudio functions on two pedagogical levels:</strong> </p>

    <h4>Shared Characteristics and Tactics</h4>
                <ul>
    <li>All individual studio courses share a broad common theme, set of guiding principles, and broad pedagogical structure as described in this brief. </li>
    <li>We come together as a whole to both kick-off and conclude each semester. </li>
    <li>We share resources and design knowledge as it emerges. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Studio Specific Content and Tactics </h4>
                
    <ul>
        <li>While adhering to our shared characteristics and tactics, each of the eleven studio courses is entirely unique to the intellectual and pedagogical aims of the faculty and institutions guiding it. </li>
        <li>Each of the eleven studios will have unique building sites, types of housing, and conceptual parameters. </li>
        <li>The Super Studio seeks to accelerate and celebrate a diversity in approaches to solving Canada’s contemporary housing challenges. </li>
    </ul>

            <div class="interior">
                    
             <h3>Shared Principles</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Indigenous solidarity:</strong> Whether these studios focus directly on Indigenous housing issues in direct collaboration with Indigenous partners, or whether they focus exclusively on urban housing issues for a diverse population, all studios will acknowledge Indigenous land relations and the effects of colonization within the studio.</li>
    <li><strong>Housing decommodification:</strong> The housing problem in Canada is a result of the rapid increase in the cost of land caused by the assetization of land and housing. These studios will explore decommodified approaches to housing.</li>
    <li><strong>Wholistic quality:</strong> The housing problem is often addressed quantitatively, as either a question of supply or price-point, but housing alienation is a qualitative issue. Housing needs to be better designed to connect inhabitants to their surrounding natural ecology, community of family and friends and neighbours, and sense of creative agency.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Housing is part of a complex system, with many participants. Architects have a deep understanding of the qualitative dimensions of home, but they don't have the training to navigate the policy landscape, diverse lived experience, and social struggles that shape the housing problem, so they need to address these issues with collaborators with other forms of expertise and within an ethical framework.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Shared Structures</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Collaboration with non-architectural partners: Studios will collaborate with non-architects, with direct knowledge and familiarity with community needs (for example: working with a local land trust, community group, First Nation, or directly with a community).</li>
    <li>A broad set of shared protocols for partner engagement (e.g., <a href="https://designjustice.org/read-the-principles" target="_blank">Design Justice Network’s principles</a>).</li>
    <li>One or more demands to end housing alienation in Canada. Each studio is organized around a ‘demand.’ These can be from Architects Against Housing Alienation's manifesto or new ones supported by local residents and organizations.</li>
    <li>Common online workshops and reviews with paired schools using tools like MIRO and Zoom.</li>
    <li>Website Exhibition of Studio Work: All student projects will be displayed on a designated Super-Studio website, launching with the End-of-Term Webinar.</li>
